                    When we are trying to buy a food item , to analyse it we generally see the brand name and judge it on basis of the brand , 
                    but what if the brand is using ingrinets that may be harmful for us some may go even further to check the ingridients list
                    but the thing is the ingidents list mostly contains scintific  names so this is where our website comes handy you wont 
                    need to google each and every ingridients to  know about the ingrident , we just need to upload a scanned image
                    of the igridients and the webpage will automatically show the details of the ingridents ,  the webpage will further 
                    help you to understand if the product has ingridents that may be harmful for you
